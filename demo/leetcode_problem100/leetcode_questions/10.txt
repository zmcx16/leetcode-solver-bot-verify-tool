Given an input string s and a pattern p, implement regular expression matching with support for '.' and '*' where:
    '.' Matches any single character.​​​​
    '*' Matches zero or more of the preceding element.
The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).
Example 1:
Input: s = "aa", p = "a"
Output: false
Explanation: "a" does not match the entire string "aa".
Example 2:
Input: s = "aa", p = "a*"
Output: true
Explanation: '*' means zero or more of the preceding element, 'a'. Therefore, by repeating 'a' once, it becomes "aa".
Example 3:
Input: s = "ab", p = ".*"
Output: true
Explanation: ".*" means "zero or more (*) of any character (.)".

Write a function:

    def isMatch(self, s: str, p: str) -> bool:
