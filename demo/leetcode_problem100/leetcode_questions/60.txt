The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:
    "123"
    "132"
    "213"
    "231"
    "312"
    "321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
Example 1:
Input: n = 3, k = 3
Output: "213"
Example 2:
Input: n = 4, k = 9
Output: "2314"
Example 3:
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: "123"
