Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.
Example 1:
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true
Example 2:
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false
Example 3:
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false

Write a function:

 class Solution:
    def isSameTree(self, p: Optional[TreeNode], q: Optional[TreeNode]) -> bool:
